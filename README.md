# Shortly - a React demo project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Shortly is a demo project that uses the [Shrtcode API](https://shrtco.de/docs) to shorten links. Links you have previously submitted are stored in your browser's local storage.

**A live demo of project is available at [http://shortly.schimek.us](http://shortly.schimek.us)!**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs the unit tests and outputs coverage information to /coverage.\
This will remove the /coverage folder before starting.

### `npm test:watch`

Runs the unit tests in watch mode.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint on TS and TSX files in the project.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
